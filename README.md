## !!!Abandoned!!!!

This project has been abandoned. It was a personal study for many libraries and it has been filled up with chaos. If you would like to enjoy moebooru sites, just browse the web pages.

## Introduction

A [Moebooru](https://github.com/moebooru/moebooru) client on Java. It's able to access resources on moebooru sites such as Konachan.com and yande.re.

## Features

* Find out pictures you like and save them in different category by one click.
* Cache pictures to boost up speed.
* Mark pictures ever viewed so you can know at which point you browsed last time and which pictures you were interested.

## Usage

Check [Release](https://github.com/azige/moebooru-viewer/releases) for latest version. If you don't have Java Runtime on your system, browse [java.com](http://java.com) to download and install it. The application needs Java 8 or newer.

Extract files from the archive you downloaded. Then execute `MoebooruViewer.exe` or `MoebooruViewer.sh` (base on your OS) to start up the application. The application should start up if you installed Java Runtime correctly.
